                <h3>12 January 2019</h3>
                <p>Fall is my favorite time of the year because of the contrast it has with spring. Although both promise cool days that are not yet cold, and warm days that aren't too hot, Fall brings in a sense of dark wonder that gives me a thrill. I enjoy the overcast days that promise fog and rain. Add to that, the rich scent of wet earth and changing winds, and it's a recipe for my perfect night in.</p>
