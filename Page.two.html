                <h3>12 January 2019</h3>
                <p>Growing up we watched a variety of movies from family friendly to musicals to horror and everything else in between. I remember watching the Blade movies, and seeing Wesley Snipes in action captured my attention. That was all I needed to get hooked on Vampires. I didn't get deep into written fiction until maybe my preteen years. I read a few different young adult novels that gave me different perspective and outlooks on vampire lore. Once I got introduced to the Twilight franchise in high school, both movie and books, I knew this was going to be a lifelong obsession.</p>
